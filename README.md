# Prime-Number-Bucketing-with-genetic-algorithm
This Python script uses the DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python) library to optimize the parameters of a spiral generation algorithm. The goal is to create a spiral with prime-numbered points that fall into the minimum number of "buckets" or regions. Those few regions that hold most of the prime numbers might give insights
